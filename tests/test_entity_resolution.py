"""
Tests for entity resolution with entity type classification.

Tests cover:
1. Entity type routing from Role.entity_type field (LLM-provided)
2. Fallback heuristic classification (polity/school/organization patterns)
3. School and organization resolution and merging
4. Updated LLM prompt produces valid entity_type values
